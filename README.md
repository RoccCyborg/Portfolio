# Portfolio

This is my sample portfolio

 Welcome to my webpage! Namaskaram! I'm  <b>Ram Prasad Pokhrel</b>, a dedicated and self-driven Electronics and Computer Engineer with a degree in ECE. I am a strong advocate for continuous learning, mentoring, and mutual growth. My technical proficiency encompasses Embedded Systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Python, HTML, CSS, and Canva, to name a few.

I have a rich background in technical training, having worked as a Technical Trainer for approximately 8-9 months in a company from February 2021 to August 2021. I have also engaged in freelance tutoring, which has further refined my teaching skills.

I had the opportunity to complete an enriching internship as a Software Intern at Intel Corporation during 2022-2023 .
